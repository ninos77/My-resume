- Make code more formatted.
- Reduce the comments.

I have tested the web page on different browsers and screen sizes and its works.


## Deployment
I have chosen to deployed my project in github pages.
Why GitHub Pages? GitHub Pages offers a lot of features and flexibility, all for free. Some of the benefits include:

- Easy setup.
- Good cooperation and communication using Git and GitHub.
- Free hosting with >95% uptime.
- Live updating with normal GitHub workflow.

### How To Deployment On GitHub Pages ?
In GitHub, navigate to my **username.github.io** repository and click **Settings**. Within **Settings**, navigate to the **Source** section within the **Github Pages** section. 
From the dropdown menu, select **master branch**. Now, all of may repositories can be found at http://username.github.io/repository-name.
